==> You MUST edit this file before you update your initrd.
==> Point the "resume device" variable to your swap partition.

==> You will need to update your mkinitcpio.conf file to
==> include the hook uresume.  Replace your 'resume' hook
==> with 'uresume'.  If you do not have a resume hook the
==> uresume hook must go before filesystems but after ide,
==> sata, and/or scsi.
==> Do not get this wrong.  Then rebuild the ramdisk with
==> '# mkinitcpio -p kernel26' (or what else needed for the kernel you use)
